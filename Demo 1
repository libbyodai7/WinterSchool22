//Simple circuit making a Leaf move a servo

//The servo is connected to pin 3
//The leaf is connected to pin 9

// Croc clip or wire to leaf or other
// input, must be conductive to work - e.g. dry plants not good

//include the circuit playgroud and servo libraries
#include <Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h>
#include <Servo.h> 

// set up your variables
Servo servo; //make a servo object

//create an integer (number) for the 
//capacitive touch sensor reading
int capsense;
//and for the servo position
int pos = 0; 

//void setup runs at the start of your program once
//this is setting up what you need for the program
void setup() {
  CircuitPlayground.begin(); //start the board
  servo.attach(3); //set up the servo on pin 3
}

//void loop runs continously after void setup
//read from sensors and control components here
void loop() {
  capsense = CircuitPlayground.readCap(9); //read the capacative sensor from pin 9
 
  //set a random angle between 10 and 180
  pos = random (10, 180);

  //An IF Statement
  //IF the capactive sensor is more than 100
  //(you have touched the leaf)
 if  (capsense > 100) {

 //THEN move the servo to the random angle (pos)
   servo.write(pos);

  } //close the if statement

  //wait 10 miliseconds
  delay(10);

 //move the servo back to zero
 servo.write(0);

 //wait another 10 miliseconds
 delay(10);
